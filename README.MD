# Rust zk-SNARKs Project

## Overview

This project is a Rust implementation of a system for creating zk-SNARKs. It includes various components like circuits, Rank-1 Constraint Systems (R1CS), and polynomial operations, which are central to the construction of zk-SNARKs.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into several modules, each with a specific focus:

- `circuits`: Defines the structure and operations of circuits used in zk-SNARKs.
  - `circuit.rs`: Contains the `Circuit` struct and related functionalities.
  - `errors.rs`: Error handling specific to circuit operations.
  - `indexed_map.rs`: Provides an indexed map utility used within circuits.
  - `sample_circuits`: Sample JSON files representing predefined circuits.
  - `utils.rs`: Utilities for circuit operations.
- `r1cs`: Implements the Rank-1 Constraint System (R1CS) crucial for zk-SNARKs.
  - `r1cs.rs`: Contains the `R1CS` struct and methods for managing constraints.
- `utils`: Common utilities used across the project.
  - `polynomial.rs`: Defines polynomial operations essential in zk-SNARK constructions.
- `zk_proofs`: Contains the implementation for generating zk-SNARK proofs.
  - `qap.rs`: Quadratic Arithmetic Program (QAP) related implementations.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project:

1. Ensure you have Rust installed on your machine.
2. Clone the repository to your local machine.
